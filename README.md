# water-quality-HPCC
Supplemental code and data for analysis in for the article looking at changes in water quality behavior after the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon wildfire in New Mexico.

Data Description
  EVI_Rasters 
    - contains three files (Mont_Output, Lour_Output, and SRUp_Output) which contain a .csv with the values calculated for the EVI raster
  Hydrun_files
    - folder 'Hydrun_Input_files' which were the yearly discharge timeseries from the analysis .ipynb
    - folder 'Hydrun_Output_files'which are the yearly outputs for the M (Mont), L (Lour), and SR (SRUp) from the input files and either the baseflow, stormflow, or the .csv of events.

    - folder 'P2 _watershed_shp' as the Mont shapefile
    - folder 'P2_WQ_Data' includes the water quality data for Mont
  P3_Data
    - folder 'P3 _watershed_shp' as the Lour shapefile
    - folder 'P3_WQ_Data' includes the water quality data for Lour
  P5_Data
    - folder 'P5 _watershed_shp' as the SRUp shapefile
    - folder 'P5_WQ_Data' includes the water quality data for SRUp
  PRISM
    - folder 'PRISM' contains the spatial average of the PRISM Average Temperature raster
  Q_Data
